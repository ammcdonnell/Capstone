          "description": "A classic folklore: In Norse mythology, before the beginning of time, there was Ginnungagap – a dark emptiness, which separated the icy land of Niflheim and the fiery land of Muspelheim. These two realms rose in power and clashed; the burning frost turned into water drops and the water drops turned into life. These life-giving drops of water created Ymir, the first living being whose death was brought about by Odin and his brothers, who were Ymir’s descendants. Odin, Vili, and Vé manufactured the Nordic mythological universe from his blood, bones, flesh, teeth, hair, eyelashes, brains and skull."

When he received a message that Hiva would soon sink, Hotu Matu’a sent seven explorers towards the morning sun, in search of a favorable land to live and grow yams. Taking yams and a moai with them, the seven explorers found a small island that seemed fertile and led Hotu Matu’a to it. This island became known as Easter Island. Some believe that the seven explorers represent the seven generations or tribes that inhabited the place, of which only one survived and mixed with the people of Hotu Matu’a. These seven explorers are represented by the seven moai that are found in Ahu Akivi."

The Sun was very fond of his children, but everytime he embraced them he burned them because he was so hot. Thus, the Moon forbade him from touching his children. When the Sun disobeyed the Moon, she tried to strike him with a tree, but the Sun became angry and started to chase her. They have been going ever since and this is why there is Day and Night. "

His younger brother Set, the god of chaos and violece, killed Osiris in jealously and took his throne. Isis refused to accept her husband's death and worked to restore his body with the help of her sister Nephthys. The two were able to partially put Osiris back together, and shortly after Isis gave birth to their son Horus. Osiris could no longer rule the world as he was incomplete, and became ruler of the underworld. Horus, set on avenging his father, challenged Set for the throne, and won after a violent battle. This triumph over Set restored ma'at to the world and Horus became ruler of Egypt."

          "description": "A classic folklore: To explain the origin of the seasons, the Ancient Greeks believed that Hades the god of the Underworld fell in love with Persephone, the goddess of vegetation and abducted her, taking her to the Underworld to marry him. Persephone’s absence on the land above ground led to the failure of crops and starvation. Zeus asks Hades to return Persephone to her mother Demeter above-ground. However, Hades gave Persephone a pomegranate seed from the underworld, signifying that she could not be completely freed and had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, spending the other two-thirds with her mother above-ground. Accordingly, the four months she spends in the underworld signifies the barren season of winter."
